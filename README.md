# Free Trial Extension
This is a Free Trial extension for the Paymenter system which allows you to provide free trials.

## Usage
You can configure the maximum order value for the free trial in the extension settings. Any invoices whose total is below that maximum threshold, will be marked as paid, and it will inform the user the free trial has been activated. If the invoice total exceeds the maximum order value and the user tries to claim a free trial, it will show tell them that the invoice is not eligible for free trial.

## Meta
The extension is licenced under the [MIT Licence](LICENCE).
